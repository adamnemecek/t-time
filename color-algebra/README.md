1. **Incorporate Novelty from the Referenced Paper (arXiv:2412.09397):**  
   The paper discusses the basic representation of the Double Affine Hecke Algebra (DAHA) at critical level \( q=1 \). Drawing inspiration from their construction, we can treat the q-deformation and the associated Hecke operators that we introduced previously as a simplified "toy" analog of the advanced DAHA structure. While our earlier code already included a q-deformed Hecke algebra step, we now refine our mathematical motivations:

   - The DAHA at critical level \( q=1 \) analyzed in the paper provides a representation theory framework for integrable structures and Macdonald-type operators. Although originally these are mathematical objects acting on polynomial or certain function spaces, we can conceptually map these structures into our simulation as "braiding" or "scattering" operators on the fields.  
   
   - By considering \( q \)-deformations near \( q=1 \), we effectively simulate a scenario where the underlying symmetry of the QGP (and associated fields) can be probed by integrable models. The novelty from the paper is the idea that at the critical level, certain affine root systems and their Hecke algebras yield a "basic representation" that is monomorphic into a smash product algebra. In our physical analogy, applying these R-matrices and Hecke-type operators to the field configurations mimics introducing integrable topological constraints or "braidings" that may reveal stable or metastable structures.

   - The note in the paper that "double affine Hecke algebras at critical level can be used to compute affine Pieri rules and underlie certain discretizations of quantum integrable systems" is particularly resonant with our simulation: by applying these mathematical transformations to the densities and fields, we are effectively exploring a discretized quantum integrable setting. This is not physically literal, but offers a testing ground for conceptual frameworks from representation theory applied to QCD/QED plasma fields.

2. **Physically Accurate EoS and Regime Clarification:**  
   To ensure that Maxwell and Dirac would "approve" this, we need to tighten the physics. We must present a well-founded Equation of State (EoS) table, including references and explicit formulae. We also clarify the role of neutrinos, photons, and axions, and their interplay with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP):

   - **QCD and EoS:**  
     The QGP equation of state is well studied through lattice QCD computations. Around the critical temperature \( T_c \sim 170 \text{ MeV} \), there is a smooth crossover from a hadronic phase to a deconfined QGP phase. For energy densities above a critical value \( \epsilon_{crit} \), we can approximate \( p \approx \frac{1}{3}\epsilon \) (conformal limit at high temperature). Below \( \epsilon_{crit} \), a hadron resonance gas model is used. We use a smoothing function to ensure no abrupt jumps.

   - **Neutrinos:**  
     Although real QGP systems formed in heavy-ion collisions are not typically neutrino-rich, in a neutron star merger environment short-lived pockets of hot dense matter could have nontrivial neutrino content. We include neutrinos with a small mass (~0.15 eV) and a distribution affected by the background fields. Their density is typically low compared to photons or quarks/gluons, but we still model diffusion.

   - **Photons and Axions:**  
     Photons are abundant due to high temperatures. Axions (hypothetical) are included to test axion-photon couplings. These couplings can produce slight conversions between axions and photons, and possibly affect neutrino production via torsion-like terms (a chosen theoretical construct).

   - **Protons and Other Hadrons:**  
     At these extreme energies and short time scales, free protons are less relevant. Instead, we have a soup of quarks, gluons, and mesonic/hadronic resonances at lower energy density phases. The presence or absence of stable nucleons (like free protons) is not modeled here. If the simulation cooled to well below \( T_c \), eventually stable hadrons including protons could appear. Since our timescale and energy density remain high, stable proton formation is negligible in this conceptual scenario.

3. **Updated EoS Table and References:**  
   Below is a more explicit EoS table with numerical values and references tied to lattice QCD results.

   **References for Lattice QCD EoS:**

   **Chosen Parameters:**
   - Critical energy density \(\epsilon_{crit}\): \(1.6 \times 10^{35}\, \text{J/m}^3\) ~ (1 GeV/fm³)
   - Smoothing width \(\Delta\): \(0.2 \times 10^{35}\, \text{J/m}^3\) for the tanh crossover.
   - High-phase (QGP) pressure: \( p_{QGP} \approx (1/3) \epsilon \)
   - Low-phase (Hadron Gas) pressure: \( p_{HG} \approx 0.15 \epsilon \)

   **Equation of State (EoS) Table:**
   
   | Phase            | Condition                               | Pressure Relation                                                   | Reference                       |
   |------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
   | QGP (Hot phase)  | \(\epsilon > \epsilon_{crit}=1.6\times 10^{35}\, \text{J/m}^3\) | \( p = \frac{1}{3}\epsilon \)                                        | Lattice QCD (Bazavov et al.)    |
   | Hadron Gas (Cool)| \(\epsilon < \epsilon_{crit}\)          | \( p = 0.15\epsilon \)                                               | Hadron resonance gas model       |
   | Transition       | Smooth crossover                        | \( w_{QGP}=\frac{1}{2}[1+\tanh((\epsilon-\epsilon_{crit})/\Delta)] \) | Smooth crossover from Bazavov et al. |
   |                  |                                          | \( p = w_{QGP} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\epsilon + (1-w_{QGP}) \cdot (0.15\epsilon) \) |                                 |

   This ensures a continuous and physically motivated transition between hadronic and deconfined phases.

4. **Color Map Visualizations and Comparisons (Side-by-Side):**  
   To better visualize how the q-deformed Hecke transformations and DAHA-inspired steps influence the field distributions, we propose creating side-by-side color-coded contour or surface plots:

   - **Before/After R-matrix Application:**  
     One panel shows the "expected" field distribution without q-deformation (or at q=1, trivial R) and the other panel shows the "actual" field distribution after applying the q-deformed Hecke operator. Differences highlight "braiding" effects on the field configurations.

   - **Gradient Discrepancy Maps:**  
     By plotting the gradient discrepancy between expected and actual distributions, we can identify regions where the integrable structure induced by the Hecke algebra operators has the greatest impact.

   - **Colormaps to Identify Braids / Wells:**  
     Using a discrete colormap or "color algebra," assign distinct colors to regions of the lattice where the q-deformed Hecke transformations produce topological "twists" or stable wells in the density.  
     
     For example, side-by-side plots of neutrino density fields at a given time step:
     - Left: A colormap showing neutrino density from a run at q=1 (no deformation).
     - Right: A colormap from a run at q=1.05, with Hecke R-matrix application.  
     Observe how certain "wells" or density pockets appear or shift. The difference can be plotted as a heatmap to show where braiding has most altered the distribution.

5. **Interpreting Changes in Densities:**
   Concern about neutrino density (~10^0) and axion density (~10^0) on the scale chosen:  
   - These numbers stem from unit choices. If we scale volumes as fm³ and energies in GeV/fm³, the absolute densities can become dimensionless or appear small. To correct this, ensure that all units are consistent and that initial conditions reflect physically reasonable number densities (e.g., number density of photons in a QGP at T ~200 MeV would be enormous). Adjusting initial conditions and diffusion coefficients can bring neutrino densities down to more physical scales (like 10^30 m^-3 or higher), and axions similarly.  
   - The "photon density" may appear suppressed or enhanced depending on the chosen couplings. The code simulates generic field conversions; if neutrinos or axions appear more stable, it might be due to the chosen parameters. You can tune coupling constants to achieve more physically plausible scenarios.

6. **From Maxwell and Dirac to QCD/QED Integration:**
   - The system is governed by QCD at its core (which describes quarks and gluons). QED effects come into play for photons and electromagnetic fields.
   - Maxwell's equations govern the photon fields, though here we simplified photon dynamics to diffusion plus coupling.
   - Dirac equations would describe spin-1/2 fermions (e.g., neutrinos or quarks if we included them microscopically). In our simplified simulation, we rely on diffusion approximations rather than fully solving Dirac equations.  
   - The presence of gravitational waves (extremely weak at fm scales) and torsion is more of a conceptual extension than a strict physical necessity. These are added features to test integrable structures and topological effects inspired by advanced mathematical frameworks.
