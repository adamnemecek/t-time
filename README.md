# Declaration of Things (& Oddities)

## 5 Forces

### Electromagnetism
* Preserved, currently probing photons for behavior through this force

### Weak Force
* Salam, preserved

### Strong Force
* QCD preserved, encouraged for exotic material generation

### Gravity
* Classical, Einstein-Newtonian-Hamiltonian

### Quantum Gravity
* Oddity explainer

### Standard Model and Planck Metrics
* Higgs Boson
* Planck scales


#### Possible Todos
* Paper
* Real number hard analysis
* Review Yang-Mills, Kazula-Klein, and early holography in string theory
* Mobile App (Swift) + Webapp for continuous lab notes, studies, experiments
* History cone (normalization of the past and future light cones as a singular meta 4D slice)
* Axion-Gravitional-Wave Paradigms, QGP, neutrinos, leptons, and exotic studies

#### Helpful Constants
* Fine structure constant = 1 / 137 --> quantifies strength of elementry charged particles
* Dyson asymptotic freedom
* Maxwell Equations
* Dirac's Extensions
* Newtonian Gravity Mechanics
* Ricci-Einstein Curvature
* Axion-photon coupling strength = 0.66 * 10^-10 GeV-1 (set by CAST)
* Photon wavelength or energy = energy needed to overcome electrostatic repulsion
* Photon density usually should be ~1 - 1.22
* Electrons have a rest energy of 0.511 MeV, thus, an electron positron collision should yield about 1.022 MeV. Anything above this is suspectible to the Coloumb Effect (the amount of force between two electrically charged particles at rest)
