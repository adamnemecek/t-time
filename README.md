# Declaration of Things (& Oddities)

## 5 Forces

### Electromagnetism
* Preserved, currently probing photons for behavior through this force

### Weak Force
* Salam, preserved

### Strong Force
* QCD preserved, encouraged for exotic material generation

### Gravity
* Classical, Einstein-Newtonian-Hamiltonian

### Quantum Gravity
* Oddity explainer

### Standard Model and Planck Metrics
* Higgs Boson
* Planck scales


#### Possible Todos
* Paper
* Real number hard analysis
* Review Yang-Mills, Kazula-Klein, and early holography in string theory
* Mobile App (Swift) + Webapp for continuous lab notes, studies, experiments
