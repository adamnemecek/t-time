# Lock In
At extremely short time scales (comparable to or even shorter than characteristic quantum field correlation times), tiny differences in initial conditions or topological boundary impositions become magnified. The “honeycomb” or grid-like pattern of discrepancy can imply that the system’s chosen initial torsion and metric conditions, combined with q-deformations and Clifford algebraic constraints, are setting up stable or semi-stable periodic patterns of deviation. In other words, the system is “locking in” to certain modes or states rather than relaxing to a simple uniform solution.
