In the improved theoretical narrative:

Midpoint Intersection: The time where photon density and exotic matter density lines cross is interpreted as a critical point in the energy and particle number transfer process, potentially marking a quantum phase transition or equilibrium-like condition under the given theoretical model.

Entanglement: Increased exotic matter formation and energy exchange with photons in a curved, magnetized quantum plasma environment suggest that underlying field states are becoming entangled. Field excitations no longer behave as independent species; their states become correlated due to quantum gravity and QED effects.

QED and Electron-Positron Pair Production: At sufficiently high field strengths and curvatures, photons can transform into electron-positron pairs or other exotic states, thereby gaining or losing about +1.2 energy units from high-energy collisions. These processes accelerate once a certain threshold is crossed (around the midpoint time).

Infinite Boundaries and Open System: Placing the system in an infinite domain ensures that the observed phenomena are intrinsic to the field interactions rather than boundary artifacts. This supports the notion that the X-pattern and the step-like transitions are fundamental results of the dynamics rather than simulation artifacts.
